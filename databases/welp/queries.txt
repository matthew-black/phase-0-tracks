Release 2: View a Many-to-Many Relationship

2.You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

SELECT * FROM users join reviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id
   ...> join businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

5|Holly|Berry|1|5|Great Food!|3|5|3|The Beagle Nightclub
2|Mandy|Kaling|2|1|Terrible service|6|2|6|Sushi World
2|Mandy|Kaling|3|3|Cheap food and great service!|3|2|3|The Beagle Nightclub
1|Bradford|Pitt|4|3|Okay food|4|1|4|Lotus Yoga

3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT users.firstname, users.lastname, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM users join reviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id
   ...> join businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

Holly|Berry|The Beagle Nightclub|5|Great Food!
Mandy|Kaling|Sushi World|1|Terrible service
Mandy|Kaling|The Beagle Nightclub|3|Cheap food and great service!
Bradford|Pitt|Lotus Yoga|3|Okay food

4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

SELECT users.firstname, users.lastname, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM users join reviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id
   ...> join businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id
   ...> WHERE businesses.name="The Beagle Nightclub";

Holly|Berry|The Beagle Nightclub|5|Great Food!
Mandy|Kaling|The Beagle Nightclub|3|Cheap food and great service!
