#--I nuked everything I had in here. I worked on this assignment
#--at Discount Tires, and I couldn't access the internet
#--to try to figure out how to run tests when my class methods
#--included gets.chomp.

#--This seems like a really important thing to learn, and I'm
#--definitely going to come back to this file and generate
#--meaningful tests. For now, though, this is all I have :(
