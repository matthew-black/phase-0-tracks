// For a provided string:
// string.length - 1 will equal the indexed value
// of the final character in the string

// I just need to find a Javascript function that
// works like Ruby's "print" instead of Ruby's "puts".
// "console.log" seems to function like "puts".

// Once I've found that function, it'll just be like making
// the loop that counted backward from 10 to 1.

// So, set a variable to string.length - 1, which will make
// the first iteration of the loop start with the final
// letter of the provided string.

// Make the loop logic be while this variable is greater
// than or equal to 0, decrease the variable by 1 ("x--").

// With each iteration of the loop, print the character
// that is returned, without starting a new line.
