# Hi Tyler! I figured I'd make the change in this file obvious...

So, here's [me at my coolest](https://youtu.be/HFGs78sd-Dg)

## ~~Git Definitions~~

~~**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.~~

~~* *What is version control?  Why is it useful?*~~
    - Version control allows you to keep a stable, um, version of whatever project you're working on, so that you're free to develop new features or refine what you've already made without having to worry about breaking anything. I can see it also being super helpful to be able to time-travel backwards through the changes you've made if you're trying to debug something. (Not that I know how to debug anything yet.)

~~* *What is a branch and why would you use one?*~~
    - A branch lets you play around with changes without affecting the master file. It's a safe way to interact with the stable code you've already written, since the changes you make will not apply to the master branch until you want them to. Branching also makes it possible for different teams to simultaneously work on the same project without having to worry about breaking each others' things. (At least until it comes time to merge.)

~~* *What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?*~~
    - A commit is essentially just a new save point. You've accomplished whatever changes or additions you set out to make, and now you're saving them so you can eventually merge them into your project. (Probably like doing a SW:KotoR playthrough, it'll be a good practice to get in the habit of making "save points" at crucial moments. Like, places where you aren't 100% sure what you want to do next, so you want to have a safe spot to return to if things don't work out.) A good commit message is short, specific, and written in present tense (which will forever seem horrible to me). I bet Hemingway would've written some world-class commit messages.

~~* *What is a merge conflict?*~~
    - A merge conflict happens when the files you're trying to merge have competing changes. Git doesn't know what the correct change is, so if two people have modified (or deleted) previously committed lines or files in different ways, Git won't know which one to accept.
