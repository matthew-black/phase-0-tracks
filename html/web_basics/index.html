  <h1>The Get Better at Disc Golf Game</h1>

  <img src="disc_golf1.jpg">

  <h2>Equipment:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>One Comet is recommended, Z-plastic is not allowed.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Any stable/understable mid-range disc is allowed.</li>
          <li>Extra overstable premium plastic is not allowed.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Four putters, all of the same mold</li>
    </ol>

  <h2>How to Play:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Tee off with your understable mid-range disc:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>On a par 3 hole, you may only throw it off the tee.</li>
          <li>On a par 4 hole, you may throw it twice.</li>
          <li>On a par 5 hole, you may throw it three times.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>After your allowed mid-range disc shots have been thrown:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If outside circle, throw all putters. Any make counts.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>If you make all 4, buy yourself a new disc!</li>
            </ul>
          <li>If inside circle, all 4 putts must be made to hole-out.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>If super close, an optional mid-range tap-in putt is allowed.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li><em>1 stroke penalty</em> if tap-in is missed.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <h2>Extra Bits:</h2>
    <p>This game is designed to both clean up your form, and improve your putting. It's very important that you don't use an overstable disc, as that will "mask," to some degree, flaws that might be present in your form. An <a href="https://infinitediscs.com/Discraft-Comet">X or ESP Comet</a> is recommended, because it isn't possible to throw it on a 300-foot hyzer line without <strong>clean form</strong>. If you need some inspiration, here's <a href="https://youtu.be/bP6F62H35sg"> Michael Johansen</a> playing in the final round of the 2015 Hall of Fame Classic. (He's probably the best professional that relies on Comets for his mid-range game.)</p>

    <h3>Quick Disclaimer:</h3>
    <p>This game is best played on a course where you'd typically score par or below without disc limitations.</p>
